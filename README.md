#### create a project with Pycharm
File ==> New Project ==> Django:
You can create a new interpreter or use the `Existing interpreter`.Then give your app a `Application name` in `More settings`, you can also run `python manage.py startapp appname` to build your app.
After creating, run `python manage.py runserver`.The following output means that you've started the django project. 
```text

#### notice
- Check your mysql username and password.If you can't link to mysql(it return a code 1045 mostly),maybe you need to add the following in `meetings/__init__.py`.
```text
import pymysql
pymysql.install_as_MySQLdb()
```
- Most APIs may need a token.After all configured you can run `python manage.py runserver 8000 thetoken` to introduce the token.
- Most time you start the project,may need to run `python manage.py makemigrations` and then run `python manage.py migrate` to ensure running.
